## 🧠 Planned Curriculum: LLM Fine-tuning with LLaMA 3 + Unsloth

This section outlines my evolving curriculum for mastering LLM fine-tuning. It is structured progressively, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, with a hands-on emphasis using the [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) framework and Meta's LLaMA 3 models.

---

### 📘 Phase 1: Foundations of LLMs and Fine-tuning


### 📘 Phase 1: Foundations of LLMs and Fine-tuning

- ✔️ Understand the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al.)
- ❌ Review LLaMA 1/2/3 architectures (differences, improvements)
- ❌ Introduction to language modelling objectives (causal LM, MLM)
- ❌ Overview of fine-tuning vs instruction tuning vs RLHF
- ❌ Learn about parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and LoRA

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: Setting Up the Fine-tuning Stack

- ❌ Environment setup (CUDA, PyTorch, Transformers, Unsloth)
- ❌ Familiarise with Unsloth's LLaMA 3 API and model loading
- ❌ Tokenizer and data preprocessing pipeline
- ❌ Understand memory usage, model quantisation (4-bit/8-bit)

---

### 🧪 Phase 3: Basic Fine-tuning

- ❌ Fine-tune LLaMA 3 using small datasets (e.g. Alpaca format)
- ❌ Use LoRA with Unsloth for efficient training
- ❌ Evaluate using perplexity and qualitative completions
- ❌ Save and resume training from checkpoints

---

### 🧭 Phase 4: Instruction and Chat Fine-tuning

- ❌ Understand chat templates (e.g. `chatml`, `alpaca`, `zephyr`)
- ❌ Curate or format instruction-tuning datasets (e.g. ShareGPT, OpenHermes)
- ❌ Evaluate model responses using prompt-response format
- ❌ Apply techniques for avoiding mode collapse / overfitting

---

### 🧠 Phase 5: Advanced Topics

- ❌ Data curriculum learning (easy-to-hard instance ordering)
- ❌ Custom reward models and early stopping heuristics
- ❌ Multi-turn conversation alignment
- ❌ Multi-objective fine-tuning (e.g. factuality + helpfulness)

---

### ⚙️ Phase 6: Experiment Tracking and Optimisation

- ❌ Integrate with Weights & Biases or MLflow
- ❌ Profile memory and compute usage
- ❌ Hyperparameter tuning strategies (batch size, lr, scheduler)
- ❌ Ablation studies on LoRA ranks, dataset size, prompt formats

---

### 📤 Phase 7: Deployment and Sharing

- ❌ Convert and quantise model for inference (GGUF, ONNX, etc.)
- ❌ Serve model using vLLM or Text Generation Inference
- ❌ Create Gradio/HF Spaces demo
- ❌ Publish LoRA adapters to Hugging Face Hub
